        <h3 class="turquoise-text">Long term goal/career pathway.</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            Longterm I really want to move back into the non-profit space. What that looks like I'm not really sure. I thought I had it all planned out but starting this study I've realised there are so many avenues to go down and I really want to spend the next 3-5 years learning and submersing myself in a range of different areas until I find a language, or career path I really want to develop. That could be data visualisation or analytics, it could be creating apps or improving technologies, it could be web development - who knows! I just know that my passion for helping to make tech more accessible in the non-profit sector is still a massive driving force for me.

        <h3 class="turquoise-text">My strengths and limitations in bootcamp.</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            I think my biggest strength is going to be relating to others and encouraging learning and celebrating successes. I think my biggest weakness is going to be allowing myself to not get overwhelmed with the pace of the work. I have found myself getting quite fatigued during foundations so being able to manage that I think is going to be quite tricky, however I am so determined I think I have the motivation and determination to push myself through and come out of it a really well rounded learner. 
          </p>

        <h3 class="turquoise-text">My biggest non-technical challenge during bootcamp.</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            Remembering to take time to have short meditations and not allow myself to get too emotionally overwhelmed. I am learning that and the core skills has really helped me with that but making sure I stick to it when there's so much happening is going to be quite tricky for me I think. Another really big one for me is going to be my self confidence in putting forth my ideas and learnings to the groups. I get really self conscious and shy around other people especially when I feel like other people are ahead of me. Trying to remind myself to take those moments as opportunities to learn is going to be key.
          </p>
        <div class="border"></div>
        <h3 class="turquoise-text">What non-technical skills would I like to see developed during bootcamp?</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            I really would love to be able to confidently present myself to a group. This is something that I really struggle with and I hope to learn more of during bootcamp. I would love to be able to speak about what I've learnt and also ask questions without focusing on my lack of confidence in what Im saying or repeating myself or trailing off. Learning how to speak to people in an articulate and confident way would be incredible.
          </p>

        <h3 class="turquoise-text">My expectations from the bootcamp team.</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            Be supportive of each other and patient. I think that for me a big expectation is going to be empathy in the varying skill levels and abilities to understand the coursework. We all think and process things different and as my self confidence is something I struggle with, knowing that the team are supportive and patient is going to massively help that.
          </p>
        <div class="border"></div>
        <h3 class="turquoise-text">My expectations of myself during bootcamp.</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            Keep focused and take the time to learn things I don't understand. If I'm really struggling with something, instead of just moving on and not quite grasping it make the time to really delve in and learn it. Use different resources and different people in the team to really solidify my learning. Be open and speak up when I don't understand something. This is really important and something I am trying to actively engage with. I will be patient and compassionate with other team members and myself. I will be honest about when I need a moment or if I'm struggling. I will celebrate success and failure as equally important things.

        <h3 class="turquoise-text">Long term goal/career pathway.</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            Long term I really want to get    back into work in the non-profit sector. Helping charities to use tech to improve their financial incoming through fundraising, and improve logistics and operations management. One thing I noticed is that there's this sort of gap between users and devs in the non-profit sector when it comes to finances and accessibility. I know how beneficial different technologies can be in improving the day-to-day operations and financial incomings for charities and I really want more charities to be using technology so they can better help more causes. I also would like to be able to create a volunteer management database for events. That's more of a fun project and something I've been talking to a friend about who runs a crowd care/harm reduction program at different events in Australia.

        <h3 class="turquoise-text">My strengths and limitations in learning.</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            I think I am really showing myself how well I can problem solve which is a definite strength and will help me with being able to move forward. One thing I have noticed and something I'm really struggling with is how to explain things to people. I often find that I struggle to articulate myself when I'm explaining things as I overthink what I'm saying and backtrack a lot and just muddle my words up. I know that I know what I mean but just making sure other people do is a bit harder and I'm very unsure of myself.

        <h3 class="turquoise-text">Commitment to managing my workload</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            I am still trying to figure out how to manage myself to work productively. Something I've encountered creating this blog as I went into a few rabbit holes which is something I need to work on
          </p>
          <ul class="body-type border main-content" style="list-style-position:inside;" > I need to remember to:
            <li> Take time out and remember to focus back on what the objective of the task is.</li>
            <li> Remember to engage with people online.</li>
            <li> Respect my own learning as well as others learning styles.</li>
            <li>Ask questions!!! (no matter how silly they may seem).</li>
            <li>Focus on gaining effective communication skills</li>
            <li>Practice, practice, practice!</li>
          </ul> 
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            When things are starting to get too much it's going to be important to talk it out. Talk to other people in the class, my facilitator, friends and family. Also it's ok to take a break and go for a walk or play with the puppy. If it's becoming too much maybe I need to revisit my scheduling and allow for more short breaks or schedule in some actual downtime instead of just saying "I'll do it when I'm finished".

        <h3 class="turquoise-text">Commitment to how/where I will seek help.</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            I will ask for help in the tech questions discord before getting stuck down a google rabbit hole. If no one can help me there then I can turn to google and/or a facilitator. If things are becoming a lot and I need help with time managment or specific resources I should ask my facilitator when I first start to notice signs of stress creeping in.

        <h3 class="turquoise-text">What I expect from the facilitation team.</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            Empathy, engagement and clear communication. Regular check-ins and help to navigate my learning.

        <h3 class="turquoise-text">Scheduling information</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            I think it's going to be important to schedule in my period. With endometriosis I find that things can get a bit overwhelming and the pain medication can make it hard to focus. I may need to make sure I'm taking more regular small breaks and making sure I am getting enough sleep.
