      <h3 class="turquoise-text">Long term goal/career pathway.</h3>
      <p class="body-type">Long term I really want to get back into work in the non-profit sector. Helping charities to use tech to improve their financial incoming through fundraising, and improve logistics and operations management. One thing I noticed is that there's this sort of gap between users and devs in the non-profit sector when it comes to finances and accessibility. I know how beneficial different technologies can be in improving the day-to-day operations and financial incomings for charities and I really want more charities to be using technology so they can better help more causes. I also would like to be able to create a volunteer management database for events. That's more of a fun project and something I've been talking to a friend about who runs a crowd care/harm reduction program at different events in Australia. </p>
      <h3 class="turquoise-text">My strengths and limitations in learning.</h3>
      <p class="body-type">I think I am really showing myself how well I can problem solve which is a definite strength and will help me with being able to move forward. One thing I have noticed and something I'm really struggling with is how to explain things to people. I often find that I struggle to articulate myself when I'm explaining things as I overthink what I'm saying and backtrack a lot and just muddle my words up. I know that I know what I mean but just making sure other people do is a bit harder and I'm very unsure of myself.</p>
      <h3 class="turquoise-text">Commitment to managing my workload</h3>
      <p class="body-type">I am still trying to figure out how to manage myself to work productively. Something I've encountered creating this blog as I went into a few rabbit holes which is something I need to work on.</p>
        <ul class="body-type" style="list-style-position:inside;" > I need to remember to:
          <li> Take time out and remember to focus back on what the objective of the task is.</li>
          <li> Remember to engage with people online.S</li>
          <li> Respect my own learning as well as others learning styles.</li>
          <li>Ask questions!!! (no matter how silly they may seem).</li>
          <li>Focus on gaining effective communication skills</li>
          <li>Practice, practice, practice!</li>
        </ul> 
      <p class="body-type">When things are starting to get too much it's going to be important to talk it out. Talk to other people in the class, my facilitator, friends and family. Also it's ok to take a break and go for a walk or play with the puppy. If it's becoming too much maybe I need to revisit my scheduling and allow for more short breaks or schedule in some actual downtime instead of just saying "I'll do it when I'm finished".</p>
      <h3 class="turquoise-text">Commitment to how/where I will seek help.</h3>
      <p class="body-type">I will ask for help in the tech questions discord before getting stuck down a google rabbit hole. If no one can help me there then I can turn to google and/or a facilitator. If things are becoming a lot and I need help with time managment or specific resources I should ask my facilitator when I first start to notice signs of stress creeping in.</p>
      <h3 class="turquoise-text">What I expect from the facilitation team.</h3>
      <p class="body-type">Empathy, engagement and clear communication. Regular check-ins and help to navigate my learning.</p>
      <h3 class="turquoise-text">Scheduling information</h3>
      <p class="body-type">I think it's going to be important to schedule in my period. With endometriosis I find that things can get a bit overwhelming and the pain medication can make it hard to focus. I may need to make sure I'm taking more regular small breaks and making sure I am getting enough sleep.</p>
