            Ever been stuck on a problem and not know how to solve it? Trying to learn something new and nothing makes sense? Everything going in one ear and out the other? I've been there. This last week I was actually stuck a lot and tried all sorts of different ways to unblock myself. Sometimes all it requires is some time away and coming back with fresh eyes, but when that doesn't work what do you do?
          </p>
        <h3 class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right">what's the story, morning glory?</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            This week we were doing Kata's. We had to write code based on tests and problem solve our way through it. I got very frustrated on more than one occasion, but the time I'm going to tell you about was when I finally figured out how to do things on my own. I was working through learning how/when to use built-in methods. These are like functions that have already been written. Think of it like a calculator, you put it whatever it is you want to know the answer to, press the = button and BAM! the calculator has done the work for you. None of this writing out all the steps to get your answer, that's what built-in methods are like. First question - got it no problem, second question I thought "this makes sense, all I have to do is this". Wrong. Why was I wrong? In my mind it made sense. Time to research. I turned to trusty Google. One of the things I didn't think about when using Google is that there is a lot of outdated information on there. I didn't want to look at information from 5 years ago as that was most likely irrelevant now and would just confused me more, so I shortened the time frame in my search results to anything from the last year. Now I was getting somewhere. So I figured out there were actually more steps required than what I initially thought. By this stage my brain was all full from reading all the information so I took a quiet 5 minutes away from my computer to just clear my mind. I needed to talk this out so I wrote down my thinking and what steps I thought I needed to take and called my sister. 
          </p>
        <h3 class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right">eureka! you found her!</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            I started walking her through my thinking, she asked me questions. Why are you doing that? What does Google say about this? How would you search that? We broke it down into smaller steps. Step one: Do I have what I need in order to be able to solve this? No, I do not. Great! What do I need in order to be able to solve it? After going back to the relevant Google tab I solved step one. Step Two: Now I've got what I need to be able to solve this problem, what is the problem I need to solve? Identify the problem. Great, now the problem is identified. Now how do I solve it? Step Three: I know what I need to be able to solve it, so how do I use it? This step was a bit of trial and error. I referred to my relevant Google tabs and started writing out what I needed to do. Each time I thought "I've got it" I would <code>console.log</code> it (will explain more about this later) and reflect on what was actually being shown. Each time I did a <code>console.log</code> I was one step closer to getting it correct. By seeing it in front of me I was able to see what had changed and identify what I needed to do. Eventually I had worked my way to an answer and got the ever desired PASS! Once I had got the pass she asked me to talk her through what I'd done. What does this do? Why did you do this? By reflecting on the work I'd done I was able to make sense of it more in a complete sense, as opposed to the smaller steps I'd taken.

        <h3 class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right">is this learning?</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            Not only was I learning new problem solving techniques, in talking my way through this I was also reinforcing the knowledge I already had. During a lot of this I felt like I wasn't learning anything, I wasn't getting better, I was lacking self-confidence. This helped me to solve the next problems. I had been going through the Discord threads and looking at what other people had written and their code which was good because it helped me to get to a starting point, but I was also feeling like I was using other peoples problem solving to get the answers I needed. As I moved on to the next 2 questions I tried to work through them myself, without looking at Discord. I started to get it. By using the techniques and reflecting back on the code I had written for previous challenges I was able to get through it on my own.

        <h3 class="turquoise-text">You got Problem Solving techniques.</h3>
        <h3 class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right">pseudocode.</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            Pseudocode is where you write out the steps of your code in an informal way, by not actually writing out the code but writing what it should do. I am somewhat comfortable with this, but it's usually a step in my problem solving process. First I really need to understand what the problem is, when I can move on to pseudocode. Once I write that down it definitely gives me a starting point for what I need to be looking up. What code will do this step?
          </p>
        <h3 class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right">trying something.</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            Just give it a shot! I have tried just giving it a shot and seeing if it works. I often find this frustrates me as the majority of the time it doesn't work. I usually get to this stage after I've moved through everything and I already have an idea of what it will look like. It can be handy in providing error messages so I can then see where I've gone wrong.
          </p>

        <h3 class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right">rubber ducky method.</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            The Rubber Ducky Method is when you talk something out as if you were talking to a rubber duck (or a pet or imaginary friend).
            I find the Rubber Ducky Method very useful. Often as I'm talking out loud I hear what I'm saying and realise it doesn't make sense, or it clicks something in me as I realised I've missed a step or misunderstood something. I have often used this (without knowing what it is) in my life when I've been trying to solve work related problems or help other people with problems.
          </p>
        <h3 class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right">reading error messages.</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            This is a tricky one because knowing what the error message is, requires problem solving in itself. I do find it useful as it allows me to look at where the problem is, identify the problem and fix it. At this stage though (and this is happening less and less) I often find that it will give me the error and I don't understand it because I don't know the code well enough to understand what the problem is. It'll tell me that something is undefined, but in my mind it is defined so it then results in more problem solving. I find it really useful for identifying the line where something isn't working and it allows me to move from there.

        <h3 class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right">console.logging.</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            Console.logging is when instead of using return or call a function, you use <code>console.log</code> to see what the output actually is. I use this all the time. When I can see what it is that I'm actually outputting, I'm able to identify where I've gone wrong and I know what I want it to look like so I can work backwards from there. With HTML and CSS when you save and refresh your page you see the changes and what it looks like on your page. When writing Javascript (so far) I'm writing something but don't actually see what the visual output is. Using the console is a really great and useful way to see this.
          </p>
        <h3 class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right">googling.</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            I use Google all the time. Learning how to Google is another kettle of fish, and something I am definitely refining. Learning how to refine the results has definitely helped me as I know that by filtering my results to the previous year I am getting the most up-to-date information. Using key words is also helpful. Making sure I include the language that I am using is so important as there are so many different languages and platforms/apps that people use it's easy to look at something and get even more confused because it's not in the correct language.
          </p>
        <h3 class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right">asking peers for help.</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            This is something I am getting better at. It's good asking other people who are learning as they have also been through a similar problem and often trying to problem solve in a similar way so being able to have someone explain who is learning as well can be useful. 
          </p>
        <h3 class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right">asking coaches for help.</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            This is something I struggle with because of my own personal insecurities. I have done it a bit this week but I often feel like I am just not understanding. I am still trying to wrap my head around all the different concepts and what they mean and the different words for different things. I often find myself feeling embarrassed for not understanding something or feeling like I'm silly because of the way I'm doing something. This is purely my own insecurities and something I am working on getting past. I have booked in some blocks of time with my sister next week to help talk through things with me as I feel a lot more comfortable talking to her and I'm hoping once I feel like I've got a bit more of an understanding about things I will feel more confident in talking to coaches and understanding what they're saying.
          </p>
        <h3 class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right">improving process with reflection.</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            This is so important. Being able to go away and reflect on what I've just learn often allows me the opportunity to come back and finetune my code. Is there a better way of doing this? Can I get there in fewer steps? What did I find difficult? Why did I find it difficult? Reflecting on my learnings is very useful and is providing me with a lot of reassurance in the fact that compared to where I was a month ago, I have learnt a LOT of new information. I often start my day with looking back at what I did the previous say, having already solved the problems, and it allows me to a) feel proud of myself and b) work through each step again and see how I got there.
