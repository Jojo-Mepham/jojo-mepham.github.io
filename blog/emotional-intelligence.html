      <h3 class="turquoise-text">Emotional Intelligence</h3>
      <p class="body-type main-content">Emotional intelligence is our ability to safely and effectively perceive, manage and evaluate our emotions. It allows us to understand ourselves and the way we communicate our emotions and feelings as wella s providing a basis to understanding other people. It allows empathy and compassion and a way to navigate difficult interpersonal relationships and a safe and healthy way.</p>
      <p class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right;">
        Emotional intelligence can be learnt!
      </p>
      <p class="body-type main-content">Emotional intelligence is something that can be learnt. Our brain is a muscle that if we regularly stretch and exercise, it  will learn the skills we need to be more emotionally intelligent. It works the same as learning a new code language or a new craft hobby, we just need to practice.</p>
      <h3 class="turquoise-text">What are the benefits of learning emotional intelligence?</h3>
      <p class="body-type main-content">Learning emotional intelligence can help us socially, personally and professionally. It can help us to understand and empathise with others, learn how to manage our own emotions and emotional expression, navigate professional relationships with different people. This can help us to lead a happier and more fulfilling life</p>
      <p class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right;">Be your best self!</p>
      <p class="body-type main-content">We often come across people who communicate and express themselves differently to us. This is especially relevant in a work space where we may be working with people who don't share the same interests, communication styles and values as us. If we have a high degree of emotional intelligence it is easier to be able to formulate safe and healthy work relationships and maintain a positive working environment.</p>
      <h3 class="turquoise-text">How can we increase out emotional intelligence?</h3>
      <p class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right;">Be mindful.</p>
      <p class="body-type main-content">Mindfulness meditations can really help us to enhance our emotional intelligence by providing us with the opportunity to check in with ourselves and how we're feeling (physically and emotionally). Practiced regularly it can help us to train our minds to be more focused and present in the moment and learn to recognise when we're starting to feel overwhelming emotions and manage them appropriately.</p>
      <p class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right;">Listen to others.</p>
      <p class="body-type main-content">Taking the time to actively and consciously listen to others can help us to absorb information and really understand where other people are coming from and what they're feeling. Practicing conscious listening is a very powerful skill to have as it also makes others feel comfortable when they're around us. If people feel like they are being heard they are more likely to speak up and take the time to foster safe and healthy relationships.</p>
      <p class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right;">Write it down.</p>
      <p class="body-type main-content">Journaling is a personal activity we can do to help us reflect on ourselves and learn more about the things that potentially trigger us, things we feel proud of and celebrate, and allow us to get muddled up thoughts out in a private and safe way. Regular journaling, even if there's nothing to say, can help to train our minds in to getting things out and also gives us something to look back on. Having those times of reflection and being able to go back and look at the progress we've made, while also providing insights into how we deal with everyday situations and triggers is so beneficial. It allows us to grow and learn and get thoughts out that we maybe didn't even know we had.</p>
