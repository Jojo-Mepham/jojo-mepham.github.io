        <h3 class="turquoise-text">How does neuroplasticity benefit people?</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
          Neuroplasticity is the understanding that the brain is malleable. This allows us to change behaviours and learn new skills. This can benefit us in many ways by changing our mindsets, picking up a new language, changing our careers, learning how to cook, rehabilitation after brain injuries, the list is endless.
        </p>
      <div class="border"></div>
        <h3 class="turquoise-text">How can we use neuroplasticity for our own benefit?</h3>
        <h3 class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right;">understand how it works.</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            When we initially learn something new, we are changing the chemical structure of our brain. This is changing our short term memory and is how we might learn something new after a dy of practising, and forget how to do it when we come back to it in a few days time. When we do something repeatedly we are changing the structure of our brain. This helps us to retain information in the long term. By continuing to practice and engage with a new skill we are also changing the function of our brain. We are shifting how our brain is activated by engaging with this new skill.
          </p>
        <h3 class="turquoise-text">How can we increase neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <h3 class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right">prepare the brain to learn.</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
          We can adapt a growth mindset and change our behaviours to allow us to feel like we are capable of learning something new.
          </p>
        <h3 class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right">practice.</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            By regularly practicing a new skill we are changing the structure and function of our brain which excites our brain and motivates us to continue.
          </p>
        <h3 class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right">increase difficulty.</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            It’s one thing to continue to engage with something you’re learning but by increasing the difficulty we increase the learning and changes in our brain. If you continue to do the same thing you’re not learning anything new, just practising what you already know. By increasing the difficulty we are engaging and continuing to learn instead of staying stagnant.

            Remember not one size fits all – find what works for you. What is your learning style, what times of the day do you enjoy practising more and feel more engaged, what tutorials work better for you, do you like to talk about it or write it down?

        <h3 class="turquoise-text">What is a growth mindset?</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            A growth mindset is the idea that we can learn new things and achieve whatever we set our mind to. Having a growth mindset increases the skill of learning through the belief that we CAN learn.
          </p>

        <h3 class="turquoise-text">How to integrate a growth mindset in the learning journey.</h3>
        <h3 class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right">failing is a part of learning.</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            Understanding that failure does not mean you can't learn something new, it provides the opportunity for further learning. Just because we may fail a certain task or it's taking us longer to understand something does not mean we're not learning. We are providing ourselves with a a new avenue for learning. Maybe we use this to pick up a new skill or learn something unexpected, maybe it increases our ability to problem solve, maybe it helps us to be able to help someone else. Use failure as motivation to further our learning.
          </p>
        <h3 class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right">celebrate others success!</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            By embracing the success of other people we are teaching ourselves that success is diverse. We don't have to confirm to one person's version of success but rather it comes in many shapes and forms. We can then learn to celebrate our own success in all it's different forms.
