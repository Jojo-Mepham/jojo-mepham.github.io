    <p>Here I am going to explain to you the difference between elements inline and inline block.</p>
    <p>Imagine you are writing an essay. When you are writing your essay and you press enter the cursor takes you down to the next line and you continue writing your essay. Great - that's what we love everything is line by line, you're happy with it, everyone's happy. Think of this as your inline element. All of a sudden you've been asked to add text boxes next to your paragraphs with a tl:dr explanation. Great! You add a text box to your word document and it automatically formats your text around your text box. Think of this as an inline-block element. You can change the size of your text box and your paragraph just automatically fits around it.</p>
