          Here I am going to explain to you the difference between elements inline and inline block.
        </p>
        <p class="body-type main-content">
          Imagine you are writing an essay. When you are writing your essay and you press enter the cursor takes you down to the next line and you continue writing your essay. Great - that's what we love everything is line by line, you're happy with it, everyone's happy. Think of this as your inline element. All of a sudden you've been asked to add small amounts of next to your paragraphs with a tl:dr explanation. Great! You add a text box to your word document and it automatically formats your text around your text box. Think of this as an inline-block element. You can change the size of your text box and move it around and your paragraph just automatically fits around it. If you try to do this with your paragraph, you won't be able to. Sure you can change the font size, but you can't change the positioning of it or move it around the page. You couldn't just write another paragraph and put that next to your other paragraph with a tl:dr explanation.
        </p>

        <p class="body-type main-content">
          Below is an image of some HTML code. This code has 4 paragraphs, 2 with an inline display and 2 with an inline-block display. You can see this highlighted with the CSS classes inline-block and inline (the CSS class is something we use to tell our HTML elements what to do). This will provide us with the base text that we will manipulate using those two elements.
        </p>
      <div class="border">
        <img src="../images/html-code.png" class="html-example" alt="screenshot of html code"> 
      </div>
        <p class="body-type main-content">
          Here we have our CSS code. This is where we tell our elements how we want them to look. You will notice I have included a height and width property in each of the different classes.
        </p>
      <div class = border>
        <img src="../images/css-code.png" class="css-example" alt="screenshot of css code">
      </div>       
        <p class="body-type main-content">
          As you can see below our text that used an inline-block has been formatted on the page. We adjusted the height and width of the text and the text is doing what we've asked it to do. Even though we included that information with our inline class, it hasn't done anything. It's like that pesky little paragraph in our word document that we can't fit to display how we want it to.
