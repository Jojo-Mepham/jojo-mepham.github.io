        <h3 class="turquoise-text">A situation where I have had an ethical decision to make.</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            This is a really difficult question.  I think I make ethical decisions daily, whether it be what I choose to spend my money on, who I choose to interact with, how I communicate with people. I think my most challenging ethical decisions are choosing where I want to work. For years I worked for a bank and struggled with that almost every day. I didn’t agree with the ethics of the place I was working for, nor the way they conducted business. I stayed there for a long time because I really valued my team members, and my team leader was an empathetic and encouraging team leader. When they left it became a whole lot more difficult and I ended up leaving that job as the cons far outweighed the pros. Once my team leader had left and the team started moving about, I found it difficult to find any real reason I would stay in a place that went against my moral code. After leaving that job I decided I only wanted to work for people/organisations that aligned with my core values. This has made it difficult to find work as I also wasn’t in a position, skills wise, to be able to be so picky. It is also something that motivates me though, not only for myself but encouraging others to choose environments that align with their moral values and encourage and facilitate moral and ethical growth in their current organisations.

        <h3 class="turquoise-text">How my culture has influenced my values and identity.</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            I think growing up on the lower end of the socio-economic scale has influenced my values and identity as I know what it’s like to struggle. I know the importance of hard work and how difficult it can be to get out of that place and how much harder I’ve had to work to get myself to the position I am in now. My culture is ever growing and changing. As I get older, I am learning to love all parts of myself and show myself and others aroha, learning more about my whakapapa and not feeling embarrassed or ashamed of the places I’ve been and who I am.

        <h3 class="turquoise-text">Strengths and limitations in learning and career development.</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            I think my biggest strength (and limitation) is my empathy. It is a wonderful trait that’s taken me many years to appreciate and not see as a burden. I would often beat myself up for being so emotional and showing those emotions, thinking it made me a lesser person. It does have the tendency to sometimes get in the way of making logical and reasonable decisions and explain thingsto people as I don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings and I'm accutely aware of how differently people process information. I think my ability to problem solve can help with the overwhelming nature of emotions when trying to learn new things. If I can take a step back and remove my emotions from an issue and look at it practically, I am able to work through problems and it ultimately helps me to develop further personally (by assessing and placing the emotions where they belong) and professionally (by learning a new way of doing something and/or fixing a problem).

            I think my ability to problem solve is going to be my biggest strength in my learning journey. Being able to take a step back and look at a problem and figure out a solution is something that is very valuable both for myself and for others. Something people often comment on with me is that ability to look at a problem and help to find a solution when there seemingly is none. Having said that I think that I still have a lot to learn in the ways of problem solving. Learning different ways of looking at things and learning new problem-solving techniques and skills.

      <h3 class="turquoise-text">Interpersonal workplace experience.</h3>
        <p class="body-type main-content">
          In my last job I was working with a woman who a lot of people struggled to work with. She had an IT background and a diverse cultural background, and a lot of people found her way of communicating to be quite abrupt and oft times rude simply because they couldn’t understand where she was coming from. We had a big IT project we were working on and other people in the team were finding it difficult and frustrating due to the communication barriers and feeling like their needs weren’t being heard and/or met. I ended up inserting myself as the sort of mediator between the rest of the team and her. I would meet with her once a week and we would discuss all the things the team were wanting and listening to her and the reasons why certain things weren’t achievable within our limitations (financial, time etc) and we would set realistic expectations. When it came to the group catch ups I was able to help her communicate with the rest of the team in a way that they could understand and it helped them to feel more involved in what was going on and the decisions being made and that it was a group effort as opposed to just one person telling us what we can/can’t do. It did work well however it also put me in a position of being the middleperson in all communications. I think if I was faced with that situation again, I would make sure that I wasn’t needed in every situation and ensure people were feeling more comfortable having conversations in a one-on-one basis. Ultimately it would be most beneficial for everyone to feel like they were being heard and provide more open ways of communicating that were effective for everyone, not just based on me translating and helping each group communicate.</p>
