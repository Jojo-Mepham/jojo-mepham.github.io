        <h3 class="turquoise-text"> Three things I have learnt about myself and my ego during core learning.</h3>
      </p>
      <h3 class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right;">practising self confidence is important.
      </h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            My mantra in life has been "fake it til ya make it" and this is something that I have struggled with in this course. Learning something like programming is not something I can just "fake" and the blow it's taken to my self confidence is not something I expected. Learning how to practise confidence in a different way by celebrating my success has been quite challenging. I think that the mantra "fake it till ya make it" diminishes the work that we put in to learning new skills and developing ourselves.
          </p>
        <h3 class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right;">it's ok to be wrong.
        </h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            I have always been a high achiever and coming into this study I have had to learn how to just allow myself to learn and not be too hard on myself when I struggle or get stuck or do something wrong. In fact, those are often the times that are the most useful as it humbles me and allows me space to learn. 
          </p>
        <h3 class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right;">i have a lot more self direction than i thought.
        </h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            I really want to do this and I've wanted this for such a long time. Knowing that this is my chance to do it and seeing my hard-work pay off has been extremely motivating. My ability to be able to pick myself up and continue the work and try even harder when I'm struggling with something has really surprised me. Looking back over my life and the things I've accomplished, it's always been there, I've just never really reflected on or celebrated that before. I've usually just focused on the times when I didn't go through with something or I gave something up because of the struggles I was experiencing. It's also allowed me to look at those struggles differently and see that maybe I wasn't giving up, I was just changing the way I dealt with it. Instead of struggling through something I can look at it and go 'how can I make this better?'.

        <h3 class="turquoise-text">What role do values, empathy, and self-awareness have in learning and programming?</h3>
        <h3 class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right;">be kind.
        </h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            Being kind, not only to yourself, but to others is such a valuable trait to engage with. When you're kind with others and kind with yourself it allows the space to grow and learn. Programming is an ever growing and changing space and there's always new things to learn. Allowing others to take the space they need to learn as well as allowing myself that space will be so important moving forward as I have a career of learning ahead of me.
          </p>
        <h3 class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right;">empathy is powerful.
        </h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            As I've been moving through this space I've found one of my biggest tools to helping me move through and get unstuck is empathy. Having empathy for others when they're struggling or celebrating is so important as it also allows me to feel like I'm not alone in my journey. When you're able to celebrate other peoples success you're also providing space for them to focus on the amazing things they've achieved and not focus on how difficult it was. It can become easy to focus on the difficulties and mistakes and when there is someone else who can empathise with that and also understand the elation when you complete something or understand something tricky, it can make a world of difference in our ability and dedication to approach the next task. 
          </p>
        <h3 class="turquoise-text border" style="text-align:right;">recognise your emotions.
        </h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            The thing I have learnt most about having self-awareness while learning programming is that I am able to start to recognise when I'm getting frustrated or it's becoming too much and I need to take a moment. Being able to recognise those emotions helps to stop them from becoming too overwhelming. Where I'm at now compared to where I was when I started in regards to the feelings of being overwhelmed is completely different. Learning to sit in uncomfortable spaces where I would usually feel overwhelmed and just allow myself to feel that is invaluable. By saying to myself "this is a bit overwhelming and that's ok" allows me to not get too overwhelmed and just take it one step at a time. I think this is such an important skill to have as it will allow me to learn and not shy away from difficult tasks when moving forward in my career. Programming is hard to learn and there are going to be times where I will look at something and not know where to start and will feel those waves of overwhelming emotions come over me. Being able to just sit with that and allow it to be what it is, is so powerful in helping me to manage my emotions.

        <h3 class="turquoise-text">What has surprised me most about the core learning?</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            I think the thing that surprised me the most was how much I learnt about myself. I really didn't expect to learn so much about myself and the way I deal with my emotions in a programming course. Being able to sit in uncomfortable spaces and push myself to seek those out has been incredibly beneficial. I won't lie, I've had a couple of moments where I've had a little cry, but that's ok! I've allowed myself to feel that and moved through it quicker than I anticipated. The feelings of accomplishment far outweigh any difficulties and I have also really allowed myself to celebrate my achievements. Learning how to do that is invaluable and has also been a lot more difficult than I thought.
          </p>
        <div class="border"></div>
        <h3 class="turquoise-text">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            Learning how to celebrate my successes. I've struggled with thoughts of 'that was good, but it could be better' so often in my life and being able to celebrate my success has also allowed me to go back and look at how I could do things better or improve things. This has been really beneficial because I improve things already feeling good and like I've done a good job and it makes that 'it could be better' turn into a 'I'm excited to see how I can change this'. It's still something I catch myself on and is going to take some time to learn, but I believe I can do it.

        <h3 class="turquoise-text">Why do Dev Academy (a programming school) spend so much time focusing on core learning?</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            Programming is hard. Working with other people of varying skill levels is hard. Being able to understand that and learn to motivate and push yourself is really important and something that is going to make working with other people so much more rewarding. As I mentioned earlier, programming is ever changing and there are always going to be new things to learn and new and different people to work with and learn from and having the ability to be aware of how you work and learn and manage emotions is going to be so important when moving into this space. Having empathy and understanding of where other people come from is so important. As someone who is so passionate on celebrating and encouraging diversity in the tech industry, it's really important to be able to have patience and compassion for other people and where they've come from. It's also so important to encourage that and empower people to be the best version of themselves, without getting down on them when things are hard and they're struggling to be that best version.

        <h3 class="turquoise-text">Does the time spent studying core learning feel like a waste of time? Would my time be better spent practising programming?</h3>
          <p class="body-type main-content">
            It definitely doesn't feel like a waste of time to me. Spending time on the core learning has allowed me to improve my learning. By learning new things about myself and sharing these vulnerabilities and insecurities I've learnt that they're not the end of the world. It's allowed me to fail and use my failures and difficulties as a way to propel myself forward and learn. It's also encouraged me to spend that extra time studying and learning. I've known when to take a minute away from the coursework and do my own learning which has increased my understanding of the coursework. I'm really grateful for the core learnings as it has helped me to understand the technical side of things a lot better, which is not something I expected.
